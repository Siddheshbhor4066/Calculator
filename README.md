# Calculator

The Tkinter library in Python provides a simple way to create graphical user interfaces (GUIs). One common application of Tkinter is to create basic calculators with buttons for numbers and operations.

In a Tkinter-based calculator, the user interface typically consists of a window with a display area where the numbers and operations are shown. Beneath the display, there are buttons representing digits (0-9) and mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
